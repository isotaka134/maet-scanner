ma'et Scanner

## Overview

The ma'et Scanner is a Python script designed for various network scanning tasks. It can perform domain-to-IP resolution, IP location lookups, port scanning, 
vulnerability scanning, and comprehensive network analysis.

## Features

- Domain to IP Resolution: Find real IP addresses associated with a domain.
- IP Location Lookup: Get geographic and organizational information about IP addresses.
- Port Scanning: Scan specified port ranges on an IP address.
- Vulnerability Scanning: Identify known vulnerabilities on the scanned IP.
- Comprehensive Scan: Perform an in-depth scan including all ports, OS detection, and service detection.
- Custom Port Range: Allows custom port range specification for scanning.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3 installed. The script also requires several Python libraries. You can install them using the provided `requirements.txt` file.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository (or download the script):
   
   git clone https://github.com/isotaka134/maet-scanner.git

   cd maet-scanner

3. Installation
 
   * Install the required libraries:
	
 python install_requirements.py
    
   * You can manually install the required libraries with:
	
 pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the script

    python run.py

   
## Usage

Once you have set up the environment and installed the required libraries, you can run the `maet` scanner script using the following steps:

1. Run the Script:

   Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the `run.py` script, and execute:

   
   python run.py
  

2. Follow the Prompts:

   The script will prompt you for a domain and then present you with several scanning options. Hereâ€™s an example of the interactive session:
